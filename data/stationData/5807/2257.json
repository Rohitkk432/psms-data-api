You'll be expected to conduct relevant literature review, manage and analyse administrative data from relevant government line departments, and implement required approaches and algorithms as modules in the above tool. You are expected to conduct robust checks on this open source tool to ensure it works for all users, prepare documentation, implement feedback and bug fixes throughout. You'll also get to work closely with practitioners and government stakeholders to tailor research design and protocols to local context, and translate technical requirements to on-ground implementation. In addition, you'll support development of high quality outputs (presentations, reports, briefs) summarising project progress, data analyses, research findings for both technical and non-technical audiences and for dissemination at various forums.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Skill sets: </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Knowledge of statistics and econometrics; Python and full-stack open source web development experience is preferred; Excellent spoken and written communication skills</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Expected learning: </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In-depth governance issues within state governments and exposure to the realities of implementation of governance reform ideas; Understand advanced statistical concepts and represent them in easy-to-use web interface; Experience of working in a non-profit with diverse and highly experienced professionals, and understand pathways to have a future career in this domain</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Specific courses required for project execution: </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Probability and Statistics, Computer Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Principles of Economics, Microeconomics, Econometrics (all), Mathematical &amp; Statistical Methods, Behavioural Economics, Object Oriented Programming</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Project 2</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Title: </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Dynamic tools for sampling, budgeting, planning various data collection activities of govt</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Description:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> This project will involve developing an open source portal that can used by any internal or government user as a plug-and-play tool to design and estimate the budget for common data collection activities like large-scale household survey, phone survey, survey of government facilities, etc. You'll be expected to conduct relevant literature review, manage and analyse sample data from relevant government line departments, implement required approaches and algorithms as modules in the above tool, automate reports and data visualisations suitable for department audiences at various levels, and go to the field as required. You are expected to conduct robust checks on these portals to ensure it works for all users, prepare documentation, implement feedback and bug fixes throughout.
