      "description": "<p>Title: Porting and Optimization of Audio Codecs on ARM, RISC-V and RX MCUs</p><p><br></p><p>Description: Work involves three phases</p><p>1. E2A (Literature Survey and Case Study): In this phase, Intern will be asked to do following</p><p>• Perform literature survey on topics provided by reviewing materials available from the</p><p>Company and other sources</p><p>• Synthesis of ideas and organizing them in a logical and coherent fashion in form crisp</p><p>notes on the subject (Notes.pdf)</p><p>• Document the findings as a technical brief that can be published to the external world</p><p>(tbrief.pdf)</p><p>• Solve the identified quiz, problem set and lab projects to demonstrate clarity on the</p><p>topics provided.</p><p><br></p><p>2. E2B (Performance Library): In this phase, Intern will be asked to optimize signal processing</p><p>algorithms available in Performance libraries like ARM CMSIS-DSP, Intel MKL and meet/beat</p><p>the performance of functions provided by Silicon Vendors.</p><p><br></p><p>3. E3 (Production): In this phase, Intern will be asked to optimize 2 to 3 codecs on ARM, RISC-</p><p>V and RX MCU platforms. Base code which need to be optimized will be provided by the</p><p><br></p><p>Company.</p><p>Duration for Phase 1 and 2 is 2 months and Phase 3 is for 3 months.</p><p>Skill sets:</p><p>1. Programming: Proven low level programming skills in C and Assembly and High level</p><p>design/programming Matlab or Python.</p><p>2. Theory: Strong foundational knowledge in Computer Architecture and Digital Signal</p><p>Processing.</p><p>3. Writing: Ability to author technical briefs/papers that can be published and write crisp notes</p><p>that assist future work.</p><p>4. Reading: Ability to read graduate level text books in Computer Architecture, Digital/Audio</p><p>Signal Processing and Audio Coding and solve problems provided in it. Ability to read</p><p>IEEE/ACM Papers and implement ideas noted in them.</p><p>Traits expectation:</p><p>1. Communication: Can articulate the work product and issues in a way that fosters team work</p><p>and win-win for all parties.</p><p>2. Time Management: Deliver tasks assigned to them on time and quality.</p><p>Expected learning:</p><p>1. Algorithms in Signal Processing/Audio Coding</p><p>2. Performance Engineering in MCUs</p>",
