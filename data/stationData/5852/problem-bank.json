      "description": "<p>Title: Re-architecting Postman's Collection Codebase</p><p>Description: Work on re-architecting core flows of Postman&amp;#39;s collection feature to optimize</p><p>performance and improve 99th percentile (aka P99) loading time metrics. Tasks include</p><p>code optimization, transitioning from synchronous to asynchronous flows, removing</p><p>redundant code, implementing pagination, and reducing complexities.</p><p>Skill sets: Node.js, MySQL, Microservices Architecture, Monitoring Tools (New Relic)</p><p>Traits expectation: Strong problem-solving skills, Attention to detail, Eagerness to learn</p><p>and adapt, Good in DS &amp;amp; Database concepts, Team player with good communication skills</p><p>Expected learning: Advanced Node.js, MySQL optimization. Microservices design.</p><p>Performance optimization strategies, Asynchronous programming, Monitoring and</p><p>performance analysis (New Relic)</p><p>Specific courses required for project execution: DS &amp;amp; Algos, OS, Databases</p><p>Title: Optimise the P95 for Public Documentation</p><p>Description: This will involve understanding how the collection documentation is rendered,</p><p>how the workflows of caching and cache expiry works, critical API loading paths,</p><p>optimsations related to the critical paths, DOM virtualisation for the components especially</p><p>in case of large documentations. This also includes instrumenting and measuring various</p><p>client side performance metrics and coming up with a plan to optimise for each of those</p><p>metrics.</p><p>Skill sets: Javascript, React, Node.js, MySQL, Microservices Architecture, Monitoring Tools</p><p>(New Relic)</p><p>Traits expectation:&nbsp;Strong problem-solving skills, Attention to detail, Eagerness to learn</p><p>and adapt, Team player with good communication skills</p><p>Expected learning: Advanced React and Node.js, Microservices design, Performance</p><p>optimization strategies, Asynchronous programming, Monitoring and performance analysis</p><p>(New Relic)</p><p>Specific courses required for project execution: React, Node.js, MySQL, OOP</p><p>Title: Load testing and scaling mock servers to support 10k rpm limit per team</p><p>Description: This requires understanding of critical API collection API loading for mocks,</p><p>optimising the matching algorithms, caching and expiry of collection data, understanding the</p><p>pods and pod based scaling, estimating the capacity of pods and improving the bottlenecks</p><p>in mock execution. This will require load testing of the existing systems and other</p><p>dependent systems in the critical path. This might require some architectural changes as</p><p>well.</p><p>Skill sets: Node.js, MySQL, Microservices Architecture, Monitoring Tools (New Relic)</p><p>Traits expectation: Strong problem-solving skills, Attention to detail, Eagerness to learn</p><p>and adapt, Team player with good communication skills</p><p>Expected learning: Advanced React and Node.js, Microservices design, Performance</p><p>optimization strategies, Asynchronous programming, Monitoring and performance analysis</p><p>(New Relic)</p><p>Specific courses required for project execution: DS &amp;amp; Algos, OS, Databases</p><p>Title:&nbsp;Improve end to end test coverage for Postman Secret Scanner feature</p><p>Description: Writing automations for Postman Secret Scanner features to improve quality</p><p>of feature. Tasks include writing integration tests, Postman collections to monitor feature</p><p>flows.</p><p>Skill sets: Basics of JavaScript, Node.js,</p><p>Traits expectation: Team player, communications, curiosity, eager to learn</p><p>Expected learning: Writing production ready code</p><p>Specific courses required for project execution: DS &amp;amp; AlgosNetwork Security</p><p>Title: Show most active Workspaces in a team</p><p>Description: Create a feature to determine and show most used workspaces within a team</p><p><br></p><p>based on different data sources like activities, user actions etc.</p><p>Skill sets: Node.js, MySQL, Microservices Architecture</p><p>Traits expectation: Strong problem-solving skills, Attention to detail, Eagerness to learn</p><p>and adapt</p><p>Expected learning: Asynchronous programming, Node.js, MySQL schema design,</p><p>Microservices API design, Monitoring and performance analysis (New Relic)</p><p>Specific courses required for project execution: OOP, DB</p>",
