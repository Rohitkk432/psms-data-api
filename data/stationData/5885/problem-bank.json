The objective is to preprocess the documents (e.g., text</p><p>normalization, tokenization) and perform clustering to identify patterns and group related content. The</p><p>orchestration ensures efficient data flow, enabling real-time or batch processing of diverse document</p><p>sources. The system will leverage machine learning techniques for clustering, optimizing for</p><p>performance, scalability, and ease of integration into existing data infrastructure for large-scale content</p><p>analysis.</p><p>Skill sets: Python, Argo, Graphs, Numpy, Panda, Clustering Algorithms</p><p>Traits expectation: Highly Energetic</p><p>Expected learning:</p><p>Clustering Algorithms: Learn about different clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical</p><p>clustering) and how to apply them to group similar documents based on their content.</p><p>Scalability and Performance Optimization: Explore techniques for scaling data processing and clustering</p><p>to handle large datasets efficiently, including parallel processing and distributed computing.</p><p>Automation and Orchestration: Develop skills in automating data workflows and orchestrating ETL</p><p>tasks, ensuring smooth, error-free processing in production environments.</p><p>Integration with Data Systems: Understand how to integrate clustering solutions with existing data</p><p>infrastructure, making the system adaptable to different data sources and scalable for growing datasets.</p><p>Machine Learning in NLP: Gain practical knowledge in applying machine learning models for</p><p>unsupervised learning tasks such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, crucial for document</p><p>analysis.</p><p>Specific courses required for project execution:</p><p>Must Have: Data Structure &amp; Algorithms</p><p>Good to Have: Introduction to Machine Learning, Applied Data Science with Python</p>",
