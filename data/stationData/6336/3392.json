Additionally, GFGC is collaborating with Deloitte to develop a cutting-edge technology platform.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The candidate will work closely with the Senior Management, playing a key role in shaping and executing business and operational strategies across the group’s various verticals and functions.
