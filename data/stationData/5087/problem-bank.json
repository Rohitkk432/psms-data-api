Work involves review of architecture and design specifications, develop test plans and test benches. Interns are also expected to execute test plans by writing tests, coverage monitors, checkers, debug failures, run simulations and track design bugs. Interns will need to handle schedules and support multi-functional engineering effort including automation using scripts and assisting on verification flows like regressions.</span></p>",

Interns are expected to work extensively with micro-architects to perform feasibility studies and explore performance, power &amp; area tradeoffs for design closure. Work also involves developing physical design methodologies and customise recipes across various implementation steps to optimise PPA. Interns will need to work with multi-functional engineering team to implement and validate physical design by running signoff flows such as Timing, Power, EM/IR, PDV</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
