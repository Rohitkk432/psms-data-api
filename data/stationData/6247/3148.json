  "description": "<p>Project</p><p>10</p><p>Title: Structural Characterization of Aggregating and Phase Separated Proteins</p><p>We are interested in the structural characterization and structural differentiation of amyloids formed by</p><p>the wt- and the mutant p53 DNA binding domain. p53 is a transcription factor that inhibits genes required</p><p>for cell cycle progression and activates genes leading to apoptosis. The function of p53 is to prevent the</p><p>cell from becoming cancerous by controlling its cell division. Thus, mutations in p53 can lead to loss of</p><p>function and the progress of cancer in about 50% of reported human cancers. The aggregates of p53</p><p>have been observed in malignant cancers. Cell models have been used to demonstrate the loss of</p><p>function and onset of tumors during p53 amyloid formation. p53 is a 393 amino acid long protein with</p><p>three major domains: N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD), core DNA binding domain (DBD)</p><p>and tetramerization domain (TD). Cancers reported with p53 mutations have a higher frequency of</p><p>mutations in the DBD of p53. The outcome of all these mutations is the inability of p53 to bind to its</p><p>target DNA sequence. Some of these mutations also show enhanced aggregation tendencies. This</p><p>mutated p53 can seed the in-vivo wt-p53 to form aggregates, a prion-like property. The project involves</p><p>mainly use of magic angle spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and possibly solution-state</p><p>NMR, combined with other structural and biophysics techniques to characterize the structure of p53</p><p>amyloids. Further proton detected solid-state NMR methods development may become part of the</p><p>project depending on the candidateâ€™s interest.</p><p>Skill sets: Principles of Biophysics and biochemistry, protein expression and purification, passion for</p><p>solving puzzles.</p><p>Traits expectation: ability to work, analyze data and solve problems with focus on understanding and</p><p>desire for details.</p><p>Expected learning: p53 protein handling and biophysics, overexpression and purification of protein, NMR</p><p>spectroscopy for structural characterization of amyloid, NMR data analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Specific courses required for project execution: Basic Mathematics, understanding of amino acids and</p><p>Protein science, ability to work on computer.</p>",
