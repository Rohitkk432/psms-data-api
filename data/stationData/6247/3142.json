  "description": "<p>Project 2 Title: Techniques in ultra-low field NMR</p><p>Description: Zero to ultra-low field NMR (ZULF NMR) is an emerging spectroscopic technique with the</p><p>potential to complement traditional NMR methods. We are investigating the application of ZULF NMR</p><p>to in situ studies of electrolysis processes in alkaline batteries. By analyzing the electrochemical</p><p>reactions and molecular dynamics within the battery, this research aims to gain deeper insights into the</p><p>charging and discharging mechanisms and identify opportunities for enhancing battery performance.</p><p>Skill sets: Basic optics, electronics, matlab/python, quantum mechanics</p><p>Traits expectation: Interest towards instrumentation, patients for systematic studies, entrepreneurial</p><p>aspiration</p><p>Expected learning: Techniques in optical instrumentation and NMR methodologies</p><p>Specific courses required for project execution: Physics, Quantum physics, Optics, Electronics.</p><p>Project 3 Title: Development and automation of interferometric autocorrelator for ultrashort pulse measurement</p><p>Description: Direct measurement of ultrashort pulse duration using photodetection is often limited by</p><p>the response time of the detector. The typical best-case, picosecond rise-times of the commercially</p><p>available photodetectors cannot be readily used to measure the duration of shorter pulses. The primary</p><p>goal of this project is to learn and build an interferometric setup to measure optical pulse duration in the</p><p>picosecond-femtosecond time-scales using the autocorrelation technique. Further, it also involves</p><p>characterization, optimization, automation and testing of the interferometric autocorrelator.</p><p>Skill sets: Basic optics, engineering, Labview, mechanical design tools (CAD)</p><p>Traits expectation: Interest towards instrumentation, diagnostic building, problem solving attitude,</p><p>entrepreneurial aspiration.</p><p>Expected learning: Ultrafast optical measurement techniques</p><p>Specific courses required for project execution: Physics/Engineering/Optics/Ultrafast Optics/Optical</p><p>Engineering/Photonics</p><p>Project 7 Title: Femtosecond laser driven structuring of liquid flows</p><p>Description: Liquid flows are ubiquitous in nature with applications in fluid dynamics, micromachining</p><p>industry or in medicine and bio science. Often, on demand shapings of liquid flows are required to</p><p>address a specific problem, which could involve planar sheets, cylindrical jets, spherical droplets. This</p><p>project aims to understand and develop the structuring of these 1-d, 2-d and 3-d liquid structures with</p><p>femtosecond lasers.</p><p>Skill sets: Basic optics, engineering, Python programming.</p><p>Traits expectation: Ultrafast lasers, Optomechanics, optofluidics.</p><p>Expected learning: Femtosecond lasers, fluid flow, ultrafast dynamics.</p><p>Specific courses required for project execution: Fluid Mechanics/Engineering/Optics</p>",
