  "description": "<p>Project 1 Title: Developing single molecule techniques to study phase separation of biomolecules</p><p>Description: Phase separation of proteins and other biomolecules plays important roles in cellular</p><p>functions and diseases. However, investigation of these processes in the earliest phase, although</p><p>critically important, is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop single molecule sensitive techniques</p><p>that can help visualize and characterize these events. We are working to develop microscopy and</p><p>spectroscopy techniques to characterize the liquid liquid phase separation of proteins such as tau protein</p><p>that are involved in the pathology of diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>Skill sets: knowledge of physics, coding, electronics, engineering</p><p>Traits expectation: interest in building techniques, coding and data analysis</p><p>Expected learning: experience with developing state of the art methodologies in biophysical experiments</p><p>Specific courses required for project execution: physics and/or engineering courses</p><p><br></p><p>Project 8 Title: Determinants of Mammalian origin of replication selection</p><p>Description: In eukaryotes, replication initiation is determined by two temporally decoupled sequential</p><p>steps; replication origin licensing and firing. During origin licensing, it is estimated that many thousands</p><p>of sites are bound by inactive replicative helicases in each human cell. However, no discernible</p><p>sequence or proteomic profile has been conclusively attributed to origin sites in mammalian cells.</p><p>Influence of DNA structure and epigenetic context on the origin selection and replication timing will be</p><p>explored.</p><p>Skill sets: Understanding of DNA and protein structure and interactions.</p><p>Traits expectation: Interested in DNA replication and repair.</p><p>Expected learning: Cell culture, DNA fibre, flow cytometry, genome editing.</p><p>Specific courses required for project execution: Biochemistry, Molecular biology</p><p><br></p>",
