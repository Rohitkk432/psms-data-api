The decision of Dean, PS is final in this regard. </p><p>? Students already placed through campus placement with a conditional PS (HD)/PS lock (FD) are not eligible to apply. Also, if a student is applying for <span style=\"background-color: white; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">ST Microelectronics</span> and also simultaneously sitting for campus placement later and gets conditional PS/PS lock, PSD will take a final call depending on the allotment scenario.
