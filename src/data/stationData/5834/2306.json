  "title": "Kinetic studies of n-butane conversion to Maleic anhydride",
  "description": "<p>Description: Maleic anhydride is one of the key precursor chemicals in the chemical industry. Its key role arises from the multiple functional groups (double bond, carboxylic groups, heterocyclic ring) combined in this molecule that can be used for a broad range of chemical modifications yielding everyday chemicals we are all familiar with. Among these are fine chemicals such as carbohydrates like succinic acid or precursors for polymers like y-butyrolactone and 1,4-butanediol. More recently MA has also become an important ingredient in biodegradable plastics, one of the key developments for environmental protection in the future. Production of Maleic Anhydride (MA) from n-butane is a highly exothermic process typically carried out in a fixed bed reactor with high conversion and low concentration feed. Due to high exothermicity, operating the reactors at high yield level becomes challenging. Present work focusses on estimating the kinetics of n- butane conversion to maleic anhydride using lab scale reactor setup and using the lab conversion data for the estimation of LHHW /ER rate kinetics. Finally, using the estimated kinetics, rigorous mathematical model for fixed bed reactor</p><p>(1D and 2D) to be developed. Skill sets: numerical methods, MATLAB, reaction kinetics</p><p>Expected learning: Bench scale unit operations, mathematical modeling of petrochemical processes</p><p>Specific courses required for project execution: Heat &amp; Mass Transfer, Numerical methods for chemical engineers, Reaction engineering</p>",
