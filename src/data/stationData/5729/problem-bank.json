SOFC is known for its high efficiency over other type of fuel cells. Although SOFCs demonstrated excellent performance, the technology suffered because of limited thermal cycling robustness of the ceramic-based cells. In this context, metal-supported SOFCs (M-SOFC) offer a promising alternative to traditional ceramic-supported designs, with advantages including enhanced structural integrity, improved thermal management, reduced operating temperatures, lower manufacturing costs, flexibility in design, and improved resistance to thermal cycling. These characteristics make them attractive for a wide range of applications, including portable and stationary power systems.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Present work focus on fabrication of M-SOFC by a simple cost-effective and industrially viable tapecasting and screen printing routes. Further the fabricated single cells will be systematically characterized for electrical chemical performance.

In order to protect the gas turbine compressor blades from solid particle erosion (SPE), SPE resistant coatings are used. Among these kinds of coatings, nanolayered multi-layered coatings proved to be more efficient. Following that, in CSIR-NAL SPE resistant Ti/TiN, TiCr/TiCrN nanolayered multi-layered coatings are developed on Ti6Al4V substrates using an unbalanced magnetron sputtering system. The present project involves the deposition of these coatings, characterization, erosion tests, and fatigue studies. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong style=\"color: black;\">Skill sets: </strong><span style=\"color: black;\">The project involves the operation of a magnetron sputtering system for the deposition of solid particle erosion-resistant coatings.
