      "description": "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">JioCinema is one of the most used mobile and TV apps in the country. Some of the upcoming projects we are looking to develop:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discovery - Android Tabs and foldables – We are working closely with Google team to move our apps to new types of phones and devices.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquisition – We are working with Google and other OEM partners to build cross device continue watching.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumption – A lot of content is available in HDR10 / Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. We want to update our Android TV application to detect device capabilities and play video using these audio/video enhancements.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ads – We are working on pre-fetching ads to improve a key quality metric - video start time </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commerce – JioCinema is used by millions of customers daily. Our initial foray into commerce with subscriptions and stickers were rewarded with customer love. We want to build more commerce hooks and experiences in the product this year.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identity – JioCinema imitates India in it’s diversity. We have premium content in many languages(dubs and original), Hollywood studios, sports etc. We are also home to largest Anime collection. We want to let customers experience and discover contents based on their mood.</p><p>Dazzle – Our customers come to JioCinema not just for watching videos but also for voting for their favorite reality shows, interacting with celebrities and even for Roadies entries. We want to take these interactivities outside of LIVE videos and make them first class citizens throughout our apps</p><p><strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Skill set : </strong>Android development</p><p><strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Other soft skill :</strong>Excellent problem solving skills</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sense of design and customer thought process</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective communication</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular updates to senior leadership and stakeholders</p>",
