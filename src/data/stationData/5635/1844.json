  "description": "<p><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Role of the Interning Student:</strong></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The group is working on a top-class tech ecosystem for its financial service businesses. The vision is to put in place a system which is highly efficient and compliant as per the industry and information regulatory policies. The system will distinguish the firm in an industry which is currently highly fragmented and localized and none of the service providers have the scale or resources for such an offering.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The candidate will be expected to</span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">build a tech-first ecosystem for all the financial service business, working directly with the Sr. Mgmt at the group level. The role will involve in-depth market research to identify and understand the latest technology trends in the financial services sector (including APIs from India Stack), working with our consulting partner (one of the Big Four firms) to build an IT roadmap for the group and drive the implementation of the tech ecosystem.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">About the organization:</strong></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Formed in 2023, Greenfinch Global Consulting is a pan India Financial Services group founded by an Industry veteran and based out of Jaipur. We provide services to Financial Institutions such as Banks, NBFCs, HFCs related to their loan processing journey. These services include property valuation, legal search and verification, credit FI and collection services.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The firm has been founded by Mr. Sushil Kumar Agarwal, Founder and ex-CEO of Aavas Financiers Ltd., a 13000 Cr public listed housing finance company. Mr. Sushil moved out of Aavas last year and formed Greenfinch, which solves the critical pain points faced by the financial institutions for their expansion. Typically, for valuation, legal search or other services, the financial institutions need to partner with local vendor at each of their branch location. This results in low or no standardization of service, maintenance overhead for a large number of vendors and limitation to quick scalablility.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Greenfinch provides centrally managed service partnership for Financial Institutions eliminating the need of identifying, onboarding and managing a new and separate partner for each service at each branch, along with providing a standardized and reliable quality service.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Structure of the Company: </strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The company has planned for 4 verticals – Property Valuation, Legal Verification, Credit Verification and Collections – under a group company.&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Property Valuation</strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> – This vertical is related to providing financial institutions with property valuation reports for the purpose of loan eligibility in case of mortgage or home loans. It is led by Dr. Amit Kumar Dass, an industry expert who has 25+ years of experience and has held Sr. Mgmt roles in ICICI Bank &amp; Aavas Financiers. The firm has 80+ member team across 7 states and ~15 partner institutions such as ICICI Home Finance, IndusInd Bank, AU Small Finance Bank etc.&nbsp; The firm also has tie-ups with Knight Frank (a UK based leading global real estate consultancy) as their only strategic Partner in India and is also a pioneer in Green Homes with the team having worked in partnership with International Finance Corporation (IFC, World Bank Group) to consult and promote sustainable homes in India.
