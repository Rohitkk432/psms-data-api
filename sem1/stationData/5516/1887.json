  "description": "<p> Oracle Database has millions of lines of code, with thousands of lines of code added or updated every day. The functional test team ensures through automated tests that code regressions are not introduced with code changes.</p><p> The security test and tools development team has an initiative to map and analyze historical data (from previous defects, regression tickets, analysis of defects, and code coverage amongst others) and provide actionable recommendations for every code change. The idea is to improve automation and code quality through these recommendations before the code is merged. Oracle Database, UI development using Oracle APEX, PL/SQL, Data Mining, Testing, Documentation Quick learner, with a good understanding of PL/SQL &amp; JavaScript, invent and simplify complex problems. UI design and development, Oracle Database, Complex PL/SQL queries, SQL Tuning, Database Security concepts.</p><p> This would be an excellent opportunity for young engineers to understand Oracle Database, write complex queries, experience UI development, and process large data to create meaningful reports to create a tool that will be used by over 500 engineers at Oracle. PL/SQL, Oracle Apex</p><p> Data Mining</p>",
